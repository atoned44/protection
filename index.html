    <p><b>PROTECTION SPELL</b><br>
      Unseen is me, protected is me, I do not show myself to thee.<br>
      I hide myself within my shield, I hide myself in my own protective field.<br>
      I am unseen and I am protected within my own invisibility so nothing can harm me.<br>
      I am unseen and as I speak these words so shall it be. x3<br>
      And so it is. x3<br>
      Amen¬†and¬†√Ä·π£·∫π.¬†üôè<br><br>
